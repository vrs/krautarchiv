what about countryballs?

weird interactions between expandthread and context.js -> smooth out surface

small and useful:
    vad Ã¤r detta
    rebind f5
    ;flush out stale hide/kill entries
    ;refresh -> highlight changes (catalog & board)
    ;thread stats, page a thread is on
recursive hiding:
    some usable way to get killed posts back
    ;support for loaded posts
context.js:
    load everything relevant as soon as there's a gap
postloading:
    endless scroll?
    ;post expansion
;thread watcher
Quickreply?
Spells?
    filter: kill, hide, highlight, remove images, assign custom class, custom JS
    hide by: OP/name/trip/words/filenames/hashes/detectors
custom CSS
CSS theme support
keyboard navigation (n/p threads, j/k posts, ctrl+return = open, etc)?
