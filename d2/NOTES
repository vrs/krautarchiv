improvements to the parser:
-absolute links
-links with nofollow+noreferrer
-subsections divided by >>123 <=> paragraphs instead of <br>
-refer to posts via >>123#2 or >>123#heading or >>uniquetitle#heading (but with numbers in the background)
-and give people subheadings (h2)
-:focus for spoilers
-replylinks
